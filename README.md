# OpenGL lessons

Open GL 1.1 samples for Windows and Linux I was created for self-learning and tuting purposes.
This project describes the basics of Open GL, matrices multiplication, and how to render geometry nodes in a rendering loop.

All projects for Windows were converted for VS 2019. 
For Linux, it is old Eclipse C++ projects that are not converted. 
However, linking is not yet working for most of the projects and requires an update of PNG libraries that are used for texturing.
